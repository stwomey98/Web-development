				Hello and welcome to our legoland, where you can see and do lots of different activities around the campus,<br>
				such as building your own lego man or you could go see lego buildings of computers and a lifesize version of the president in lego form.<br>
				There is many different areas on the campus that you can see the lego structures, the vast makority of them are being shown in the art gallery as the design is top notch.<br>
				Here is a video of some work done with lego on <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5ERLUkdrGg&t=96s">youtube</a>. There are many students that are in our group of builders many of which<br>
				have loved lego since they were children and some that have just gotten into it and there has been many new friendships formed because of this.<br>
				We welcome anyone else that would like to join and people that do join can get a mini figure of themselves made. Our club will be five years old as of july 20<sup>th</sup> so we hope to see you there.<br> 
				Here is one our projects during our summer work.

			<p>	Below is a video that you can watch while still staying on this page. We would also like to thank our president of the club <em>John O'Leary</em> 
			for making this club, for continuing his work every year<br> with other members and for organising all of this. There are many other people that are involved in the making of this club, we were told it's a group effort which webelieve to be true and we strive<br> to stick to our level of dedication.
			A simple quote from our president is <q>there will never be a day that is completely perfect</q>
